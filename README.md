# Time-Series-AirPassengers-Forecasting-Using-LSTM-Bidirectional

LSTM-Bidirectional is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that processes sequences in both forward and backward directions.
The output of the forward and backward LSTMs are then concatenated, providing the network with more context to make predictions. 
This bidirectional processing can improve the performance of the network, especially when working with long sequences of data.

The benefits of a bidirectional LSTM model include:

a. Improved performance in sequence prediction tasks.
b. Better understanding of contextual information in sequences.
c. Increased accuracy for tasks with long-term dependencies.
d. Better handling of sequence data with complex patterns.
e. Better ability to capture dependencies in sequences with different time scales.

Forecasting air passenger demand using a machine learning bidirectional LSTM model involves the following steps:

- Data collection: Obtain historical air passenger data, including the number of passengers for each flight.
- Data preparation: Clean and preprocess the data, such as handling missing values and transforming the data into a suitable format for modeling.
- Model selection: Select a bidirectional LSTM model as the model architecture.
- Model training: Train the model on the preprocessed data using a suitable optimization algorithm.
- Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).
- Model deployment: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data.
- Model updating: Regularly update the model with new data to ensure that it continues to make accurate predictions.

By using a bidirectional LSTM model, it is possible to effectively capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in air passenger data and make accurate predictions of future air passenger demand.
